# 25. September 2014, Lukas and Cameron are playing around with data

# choosing some data from the core R data sets on US States statistics

data(state)
?state
state.x77

# state.x77 is a interetsing matrix, we go on with this one

statedata1 <- data.frame(state.x77, state.x77, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # pulling out the "state.x77" matrix with 50 rows and 8 columns giving some statistics in the respective columns.

# we are interested in Murder (Murder and Non-negligent Manslaughter rate per 100,000 Population (1976))
summary(statedata1$Murder) 

# making a barplot showing
barplot(statedata1$Murder, main="Murder and Non-negligent Manslaughter rate per 100,000 Population (1976)", names.arg = state.abb, las=2, xlab="US States", space=1)

# we did not do the "setwd" with harddrive directory thing, as we were working on github online only
# hopefully this works instead

install.packages("devtools")
source_url('http://github.com/LBRETZIN/TestS18/blob/TestBranch/A1women.txt')

# the end :)
