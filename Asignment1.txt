# 25. September 2014, Lukas and Cameron are playing around with data

# choosing some data from the core R data sets on US States statistics
statedata1 <- data.frame(state.x77, state.x77, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # pulling out the "state.x77" matrix with 50 rows and 8 columns giving some statistics in the respective columns.

# making a barplot showing
barplot(state.data$Murder, main="Murder and Non-negligent Manslaughter rate per 100,000 Population (1976)", names.arg = state.abb, las=2, xlab="US States", space=1)
